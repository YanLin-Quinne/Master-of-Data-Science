# Master-of-Data-Science
Code and reports submitted for the Master of Data Science course (2022-2023, University of Durham)

I am currently continuing my course work and dissertation project, so the code is not yet complete.

## Machine Learning
`ML-Python.ipynb`, `ML-R.R` and `Machine Learning.pdf`

## Programming for Data Science
`Programming.ipynb` and `Programming_Report.pdf`

Received mark: 82.5. 'The visualization task in question 3 is perfect, as is the Bayesian network in question 4'

## Introduction to Computer Science
`ICS_Coursework.ipynb`

Received mark: 76. 'There are essentially no deductions for the code section'

## Introduction to Statistics for Data Science

`ISDS_Assignment2.R` and `ISDS_Assignment 2(Yan Lin).pdf` 

Received mark: 74.
